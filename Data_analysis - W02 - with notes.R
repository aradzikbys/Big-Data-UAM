# Artificial example

# 100 numbers in range (0,1)
x1 <- rnorm(100)

# x2 correlates with x1 with some "noise" >> [+ sqrt(1/3) * temp1]

# Means

# PCA with scores

# created by the principal components, which are most often visualized.

biplot(model.pca, scale = 0)

# In general, biplot vectors can be interpreted in three ways (Rossiter 2014):

# The orientation (direction) of the vector, with respect to the principal
# component space, in particular, its angle with the principal component axes:
# the more parallel to a principal component axis is a vector, the more it contributes only to that PC.

# The length in the space; the longer the vector, the more variability of this
# variable is represented by the two displayed principal components; short vectors
# are thus better represented in other dimension.

# The angles between vectors of different variables show their correlation in
# this space: small angles represent high positive correlation, right angles
# represent lack of correlation, opposite angles represent high negative correlation.


# PC1 is some kind of average of all the measurements => measure of size of the bird
# PC2 has a negative weight for 'sternum' and positive weights for 'alar', 
# 'head' and 'humerus' => measure of shape of the bird (?)
